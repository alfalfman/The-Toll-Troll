# Question One: Word Descramble
# to win the first challenge the user must first correctly descramble a given word
    # print scrambled word
    # Ask the user to input their guess for the descrambled world 
        # if they guess correctly, print "Correct! Move on to question two."
        # if they guess incorrectly, print "Wrong guess, try again. Attempt: 1"
        # if the user guesses incorrectly, give them a hint. 
            # print "the word starts with ___"
        # if the user cannot guess correctly within three tries, end the game
            # print: "Maximum attempts exceeded. Better luck next time!" and end the game
            # print: goodbye! 

Attempt #1:
def word_scrambler():
    correct_word = "gambit"
    scrambled_word =  shuffle(correct_word)
    print(f"For your first challenge, unscramble the following word:{scrambled_word}")

    user_word = input("> ")

    if user_word is correct_word:
        print()


Attempt #2:
import random

correct_word = "gambit"
scramble_word = random.sample(correct_word, 6)

scrambled_word = correct_word.join(scramble_word)



print(scrambled_word)
 
Attempt #3:


def word_scrambler(answer):
    import random
    scramble_word = random.sample(answer, 6)
    scramble_word = "".join(scramble_word)

    return scramble_word

    print(f"Unscramble the following word: {scrambled_word}")
    print()

    user_guess = input("> ").lower()
    print()

    if user_guess == answer:
        print("yay! you win!")
    else:
        print("boo! you lose!")
